          <div class="story-content">
            <h2>Before: The Struggle Was Real</h2>
            <p>Like many wives and mothers, I was doing everything I thought was "right" for my health‚Äîeating what experts called healthy foods, following popular diets, and trying various supplements. But I still felt tired, dealt with digestive issues, and watched my family struggle with their own health challenges.</p>
            
            <p>The frustrating part? The more I tried conventional approaches, the more complicated everything became. Different symptoms seemed to require different solutions, different specialists, different medications. It felt like I was treating an endless list of separate problems instead of addressing what was really going wrong.</p>

            <h2>The Turning Point: Meeting Dr. Wallach's Wisdom</h2>
            <p>Everything changed when I was introduced to the work of Dr. Joel Wallach and Pharmacist Ben Fuchs. For the first time, someone was explaining health in a way that made sense‚Äînot as a collection of random symptoms to suppress, but as a simple matter of giving the body what it needs and stopping what damages it.</p>

            <blockquote>
              "The human body is a self-healing, self-regenerating machine. All it needs are the right raw materials and the removal of obstacles."
            </blockquote>

            <p>This philosophy clicked for me immediately. Instead of chasing symptoms, I could focus on two simple root causes: fixing my digestive system (the gateway) and stabilizing my blood sugar (the engine).</p>
